	<p>Hi, I'm Thomas Brochhagen</p>
	<p>I'm currently a PhD student at the <a href="http://www.illc.uva.nl/" target='_blank'>Institute for Logic, Language and Computation</a> in Amsterdam. My research revolves around uncertainty in communication. More precisely, I deal with the question why we often leave to the unsaid what could have been said more explicitly. Relatedly, I ask why, rather than evolving toward more overt precision, natural language seems to foster ambiguity and underspecification.</p>
