  <h1>Guidelines on LM-generated content / AI-assistance</h1>
  [cite_start]<p>This document lays out my personal policy concerning content generated by Language Models (LMS), and assistance through artificial intelligence more generally. [cite: 1, 2]</p>
  [cite_start]<p>I expect people working with me -students and collaborators- to adhere to these guidelines; or to let me know if they don't. [cite: 3, 4] These guidelines are not set in stone. [cite_start]They are bound to change over time. [cite: 4, 5] [cite_start]I'm happy to talk about them with you if you disagree with them. [cite: 5]</p>
  [cite_start]<p>If you are a student, please note that this document is complementary to your institution's guidelines on the topic. [cite: 6] [cite_start]Always adhere to the stricter of the two. [cite: 7] [cite_start]For example, If your university explicitly states that Al is prohibited for your thesis then it is prohibited. [cite: 7]</p>
  [cite_start]<p>Here are the guidelines for UPF: <a href="https://quiesbibtic.upf.edu/iag/normativa">https://quiesbibtic.upf.edu/iag/normativa</a>. [cite: 8]</p>

  <h2>Writing</h2>
  [cite_start]<p>I believe that writing is an important and central tool of scientific inquiry. [cite: 10] [cite_start]Writing is thinking. [cite: 10] [cite_start]And producing scientific writing allows you to share your personal perspective on the topic with others. [cite: 11] [cite_start]There is value to it. [cite: 11] [cite_start]Heavily relying on LMs for your writing means that you are robbing yourself of the chance to think; [cite: 12] [cite_start]of others of your way of thinking; and me of my time by having me edit and revise a text that you didn't write yourself. [cite: 13]</p>
  [cite_start]<p>Accordingly, I expect that (minimally) the first and last version of anything you write was written, read, approved, and digested by yourself. [cite: 14] [cite_start]You are free to use an LM to edit the intermediate stages of your writing. [cite: 15] [cite_start]I certainly see the benefits in using technology for light editing. [cite: 16] [cite_start]In other words, editing (e.g., grammar, typos or that one sentence that is awkward but you don't know how to reformulate) is fine but not the generation of text or content. [cite: 17] [cite_start]If the text is not yours then it is not OK to pass it off as yours. [cite: 18]</p>

  <h2>Programming</h2>
  [cite_start]<p>As with writing, programming is a way to lay out your thoughts. [cite: 20] [cite_start]There are parts that can be useful to automatize (e.g., you forgot the syntax for printing and co-pilot offers you a suggestion) and others that are not (e.g., you don't know what a parameter in pytorch does and co-pilot offers a suggestion). [cite: 21]</p>
  [cite_start]<p>As with writing, you are ultimately responsible for understanding all of your code. [cite: 22] [cite_start]Anything generated by a model needs to be accordingly checked thoroughly and approved by you. [cite: 23] [cite_start]If you want concrete suggestions on how to check your code and be responsible for it, let me know. [cite: 24]</p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  [cite_start]<p>You are responsible for your scientific output. [cite: 26]</p>
